Rythm Keypad 4x4 with Arduino


Developed by KosKou

The system is designed to turn on the user's contact with the digital sensor module, which starts the system, 
once the program has been validated if a previous scale was selected, otherwise it will not emit any sound; the 
scale is selected with the letters of the keyboard taking into account the start in the third scale of 4 possible 
octaves, the model analyzes the frequency to be broadcast according to the frequency table (Figure 4) and sends the 
signal to the buzzer, passing previously through the sound modulation to be emitted with the potentiometer and 
with the help of the amplifier PAM8403.
